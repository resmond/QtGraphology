# QtGraphology
Personal experiment to explore the overlap / synergy between NodeGraphQt and PyQtGraph.

# Sources and Achnolegements:
I considered forking the project/code from QtGraphology but was very concerned that using his project as a playground would be more disruptive than useful so I started a new repository and will look to contributing what tests out back into his codeset on a case by case basis.

Full disclosure I've done production coding on C/C++, C#, Java, JavaScript and TypeScript over the decades but never Python.  My all-time favorite became TypeScript because of its combination of sophisticed ability to define complex data models and rich capabilities to compose classes and mixins for robust solutions.  It didn't start out that way but I felt it utimately punched above its weight.

I'm very new to Python but It looks like similiar capabilities might exist within the Python ecosystem, so I am to find out.

# Current Intent:
    1) Move the codebase to PyQt6 and PySide6 to determine if that simplifies furthurther development
    2) Integrate PyQtGraph into codebase to cover:
        a) Complex diagramming with both UI and Rendering
        b) Sophisticated charting/analytics for visualization instramentation data

    3) Explore integration with two incredible platform for CAD and CNC infrastructure:
        a) FreeCAD
        b) LinuxCNC

    4) Explore an integrated Graph/Path based data-model that spans across the entire life-span of a physical project
        a) Capture of parametric elements of the pysical design structure
        b) 3D CAD designs based on those structures
        c) Computer aided modeling to translate designs into manufacurable recipies (G-Code) for:
            1) 3D Printers
            2) CNC tools

FreeCAD and LinuxCNC are both robust platforms that already share the common DNA of Python and Qt and each have a broad ecosystem of plugins to provide most of what I'm describing.

What I'm hoping to do is see how well the two can be mixed together and bring my Python sklls up to speed in the process.

Wish me luck.
